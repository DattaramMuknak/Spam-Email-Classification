# Spam Email Classification

This project demonstrates spam email classification using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). 

## Project Structure

- `Spam_Email_Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the code and analysis.
- `spam.csv`: Dataset containing email data for classification.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Spam_Email_Classification.ipynb`) to view the implementation.
2. Use the `spam.csv` dataset to train and evaluate the model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib

## Objective

To build a machine learning model that classifies emails as spam or not spam, ensuring email communication remains secure and efficient.
